# Elden Ring Weapon Attack Calculator

A weapon calculator that allows comparing multiple weapons and infusions. Try it at [eldenring.tclark.io](https://eldenring.tclark.io/).

Enter your stats and your criteria (weapon type, affinity, etc). The app will list every weapon matching your selections, along with the attack rating and status buildup you'll get on your build. Click a column header to sort the table by that column.

## Special Thanks

This was inspired the [Dark Souls Weapons Attack Calculator](https://soulsplanner.com/darksouls/weaponatk). As far as I know, the creator hasn't made an updated version for Elden Ring, so I put this together.

Regulation data was extracted from the game using [DSMapStudio](https://github.com/soulsmods/DSMapStudio).

Elden Ring Reforged support uses data from the [Elden Ring Reforged](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/541) mod provided by [ivi](https://github.com/ividyon) from the ERR team.

The Convergence Mod support uses data extracted from [The Convergence Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/3419) public alpha on Nexus Mods.

## Reporting Issues
